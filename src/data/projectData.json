One further objective was an optimal viewing experience on mobile devices.<br><br>-->",

I was there in a part-time position for webpage maintenance and volunteered to provide a mobile-friendly layout. Decision was made to not replace the existing site but use the mobile layout as an add-on; i.e. replicating the content in a new format, while keeping the old files intact. Process was as above: isolate artwork data and image url from existing files; consolidate data into a .csv file (which works as sort of a pseudo-database). I then created a utility in VB which accepted the data .csv and different types of template files to process them into new .html files with the revised layout."
