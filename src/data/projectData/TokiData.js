const introText = `Toki no Wasuremono is an art gallery in Aoyama, Tokyo, specializing in 20th Japanese avant-garde art, photography and prints by major Japanese architects. Featured artists include Tadao Ando, Arata Isozaki, members of the Gutai group, Q-Ei, Nobuo Sekine, the photographers Eikoh Hosoe, Tamiko Nishimura etc. The homepage promotes exhibitions and events at the gallery. It allows customers to post inquiries about works and/or to place orders. The homepage is particularly important because more and more sales go to foreign (i.e., non-Japanese) customers who rarely visit the gallery in person but order online.<br><br>
