Re-opening was planned for 2020 but delayed due to Covid. Collection holdings: about 5000 items, and growing. <br><br>

As of 2020, <strong>no proper collections database existed</strong>; collection items were catalogued as individual .pdf files. There is apparent need for a professional collections management solution, as the museum continues to grow. Design emphasis: Simplicity, straightforwardness, and a modern, easy-to-use interface. Note this project didn't proceed beyond concept stage as the museum insisted on the developer moving to Tokyo, which was not practical at the time.
